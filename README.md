# Ats_Integration_Process
“I built a Python-based unified ATS API using Serverless Framework. It integrates with Zoho Recruit using OAuth2 refresh tokens, normalizes job, candidate, and application data, and exposes REST APIs like GET /jobs, POST /candidates, and GET /applications. The system is designed to be extensible to other ATS platforms.”
